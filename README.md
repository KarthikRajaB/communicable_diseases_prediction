Our study proposes a novel approach based on climate data to forecast dengue and Chikungunya cases using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Our findings show that our LSTM and SVR models outperform standard statistical models and other machine-learning methods in terms of disease incidence prediction. Our suggested method has potential implications outside Kerala, including the capacity to estimate disease occurrence in other regions with similar climatic conditions. The approaches provide useful information to public health officials and policymakers, resulting in more efficient vector-borne disease management and prevention efforts.
